High-level pseudocode of what the process might look like, mainly if you were doing a neural style transfer:

```python
# Pseudocode for using Neural Style Transfer for Art Generation

# Imports and setup (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load pre-trained Neural Style Transfer Model
model = load_model('pretrained-style-model')

# Load your content image and style image
content_image = load_image('your_photo.jpg')
style_image = load_image('famous_painter_style.jpg')

# Apply the model to your images
stylized_image = model.transfer_style(content_image, style_image)

# Display the result
plt.imshow(stylized_image)
plt.show()

# Save the generated image
save_image(stylized_image, 'your_stylized_photo.jpg')
```
