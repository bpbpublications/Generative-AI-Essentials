code might look in Python, using the `openai` Python package:

```python
import openai

# Ensure you have your API key set in your environment or pass it explicitly
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

# Step 4: Generate the Poem with prompt
def generate_romantic_poem():
    response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-003",  # or the latest available version
      prompt="Write a poem in the style of Romantic poetry about the beauty of nature:",
      temperature=0.7,  # Adjusts randomness
      max_tokens=150,  # Limits the length of the generated text
      top_p=1,
      frequency_penalty=0,
      presence_penalty=0
    )
    poem = response.choices[0].text.strip()  # Extracting the text generated
    return poem

# Generate and print the poem
print(generate_romantic_poem())
```
