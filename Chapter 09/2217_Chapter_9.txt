Implementing an AI system to detect signs of diabetic retinopathy using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) involves several steps. Below is an outline of the steps, accompanied by example code snippets, expected outputs, and potential challenges:
1. Set up a GCP project:
     ```bash
     gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID
     gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
     ```
    Output: Project created and configured.

2. Enable AI API services:
     ```bash
     gcloud services enable vision.googleapis.com
     gcloud services enable ml.googleapis.com
     ```
    Output: API services enabled

3. Upload images to cloud storage:
     ```bash
     gsutil cp image1.jpg gs://yourbucket/
     gsutil cp image2.jpg gs://yourbucket/
     ```
    Output: Images uploaded to Cloud Storage.

4. Create a Machine Learning Model (Code using AutoML Vision API):
     ```bash
     gcloud aiplatform models create diabetic_retinopathy_model
     ```
    Output: Model created

5. Train the Model(Code AutoML vision):
     ```bash
     gcloud aiplatform jobs submit training diabetic_retinopathy_training_job \
       modulename trainer.task \
       packagepath ./trainer \
       stagingbucket gs://yourstagingbucket/ \
       region uscentral1
     ```
    Output: Training job initiated.

6. Deploy the model:
     ```bash
     gcloud aiplatform versions create v1 \
       model diabetic_retinopathy_model \
       origin gs://yourmodeldirectory/
     ```
    Output: Model deployed.

7. Use the model to predict (Code using Vision API):
     ```bash
     gcloud aiplatform predict \
       model diabetic_retinopathy_model \
       jsoninstances input.json
     ```
