DRL is a powerful technique that uses deep neural networks to handle complex tasks with high-dimensional state spaces. It allows RL agents to learn and decide in situations with many variables.
       Code and output:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow. Keras. layers import Dense
import numpy as np
import gym

# Create an environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Define a deep neural network model
model = tf. keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(env.observation_space.shape[0],)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(env.action_space.n, activation='linear')
])

# Define the optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Training loop
num_episodes = 1000
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    episode_reward = 0
    done = False

    while not done:
        # Choose an action based on the current state
        action = np.argmax(model.predict(np.expand_dims(state, axis=0)))

        # Take the chosen action, observe the next state and reward
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        # Calculate the target Q-value
        target = reward + 0.99  np.max(model.predict(np.expand_dims(next_state, axis=0)))

        # Calculate the Q-value for the chosen action
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            q_values = model(np.expand_dims(state, axis=0))
            action_q_value = q_values[0, action]
            loss = loss_fn(target, action_q_value)

        # Update the model
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

        # Update the current state and episode reward
        state = next_state
        episode_reward += reward

    print(f"Episode {episode + 1}, Reward: {episode_reward}")
```
