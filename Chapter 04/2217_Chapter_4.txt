simple code example using Python to demonstrate this analogy. 
The following is a basic Python function to simulate the page-at-once reading approach.

def read_page_at_once(page_content):
    # Simulating the "page-at-once" reading
    understanding = analyze_content(page_content)
    return understanding

def analyze_content(content):
    # Placeholder for actual analysis logic
    # For simplicity, let's print the content for demonstration
    print("Understanding:", content)
    return content

# Example text (our "page")
text_to_read = "Transformers are amazing language models that read the entire page simultaneously."

# Processing text with our "page-at-once" reading function
result = read_page_at_once(text_to_read)
print(result)
