Implementing a chatbot using Transformers involves several steps. Below is a simplified guide using Hugging Face's Transformers library in Python.
1. Install required libraries: Install the Transformers library and any other necessary packages. Refer to the following code:
2. Import libraries
```bash
pip install transformers
```
Refer to the following code:
```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
```
3. Load pre-trained model and tokenizer: Choose a pre-trained language model and load it along with its tokenizer. Refer to the following code:
```python
model_name = "gpt2"  # You can choose a different model based on your requirements
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```
4. Chat with the model: Implement a simple chat loop where the user can interact with the model. Refer to the following code:
```python
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    
    # Tokenize the user input
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(user_input, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate a response from the model
    output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_beams=5, no_repeat_ngram_size=2, top_k=50, top_p=0.95, temperature=0.7)

    # Decode and print the model's response
    bot_response = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Chatbot: {bot_response}")
