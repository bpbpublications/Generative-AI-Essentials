Applying style transfer to an image to demonstrate art generation and style transfer using the Google Cloud Platform.
```bash
!pip install tensorflow pillow ``` 
A simplified Python script uses TensorFlow and Pillow to apply style transfer to an input image using a pre-trained model. Save this code to a Python file, e.g., `style_transfer.py`: 
```python
>> import tensorflow as tf >>import numpy as np
>>import PIL.Image
>>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
# Load the pre-trained VGG19 model 
>>model = tf.keras.applications.VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet') 
# Define content and style layers content_layers = ['block5_conv2'] 
style_layers = ['block1_conv1', 'block2_conv1', 'block3_conv1', 'block4_conv1', 'block5_conv1'] 
num_content_layers = len(content_layers) num_style_layers = len(style_layers) 
# Load and preprocess your content and style images # Define functions to compute content and style loss 
# Define the model for style transfer
# Create a target and initialize it with your content image # Optimize the target image using TensorFlow
``` 
5. Run the style transfer script: Execute the Python script using: 
```bash
>>python style_transfer.py ```
