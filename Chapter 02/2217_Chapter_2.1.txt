Example 2 :Setting up Google Colab: ```python!pip install tensorflow !pip install pillow``` 3. Importing libraries: #python>>import tensorflow as tf >>import numpy as np>>from PIL import Image>>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ```pythondef load_image(image_path): max_dim = 512img = Image.open(image_path)img = ImageOps.fit(img, (max_dim, max_dim), Image.ANTIALIAS) img = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(img)img = tf.keras.applications.vgg19.preprocess_input(img) return img content_path = 'content.jpg' style_path = 'style.jpg' Creating a complete code example for style transfer using TensorFlow in Google Colab is beyond the scope of a single response due to its complexity. Let us look at a basic outline and code snippets to get started. You would typically work within a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script to create the entire code. Here is a simplified version of the code with crucial steps: 1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 2. Create a new Python 3 notebook. 2. Installing required libraries: You need to install TensorFlow, which includes the pre-trained VGG19 model, and Pillow for image manipulation: 4. Load and preprocess images: Load your content image and style image and preprocess them to fit the VGG19 model's input requirements: content_image = load_image(content_path) style_image = load_image(style_path)``` 5. Define content and style layers: ```pythoncontent_layers = ['block5_conv2'] style_layers = [    'block1_conv1',    'block2_conv1',    'block3_conv1',    'block4_conv1',    'block5_conv1']num_content_layers = len(content_layers) num_style_layers = len(style_layers)``` ```pythondef vgg_layers(layer_names): vgg = tf.keras.applications.VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet') vgg.trainable = Falseoutputs = [vgg.get_layer(name).output for name in layer_names] model = tf.keras.Model([vgg.input], outputs)return model style_extractor = vgg_layers(style_layers) style_outputs = style_extractor(style_image * 255) content_extractor = vgg_layers(content_layers) content_outputs = content_extractor(content_image * 255) ``` 7. Define the style and content loss functions: ```python def style_content_loss(style_targets, style_outputs, content_targets, content_outputs): # Define your loss functions here ``` 6. Build the Model: Load a pre-trained VGG19 model and select the layers for content and style representations: 8. Apply style transfer: ```pythondef high_pass_x_y(image): x_var = image[:, :, 1:, :] - image[:, :, :-1, :] y_var = image[:, 1:, :, :] - image[:, :-1, :, :] return x_var, y_var # Apply style transfer and optimization here ``` Style transfer is a complex topic, and the code provided is a simplified overview. In practice, you would fine-tune various parameters and use optimization techniques like L-BFGS or Adam to achieve better results. Additionally, you may need to work with GCP to deploy and scale such models in a production environment.
