Given below is a simplified pseudocode to present a conceptual understanding of the morphing process:
```python
def image_morph(start_image, end_image, feature_points, num_frames):
    frames = []
    for i in range(num_frames):
        # Calculate the interpolation factor (0 means all start image, 1 means all end image)
        alpha = i / num_frames
        
        # Interpolate the positions of the feature points
        intermediate_points = interpolate(feature_points['start'], feature_points['end'], alpha)
        
        # Warp both images towards the intermediate feature points
        warped_start = warp_image(start_image, feature_points['start'], intermediate_points, alpha)
        warped_end = warp_image(end_image, feature_points['end'], intermediate_points, 1alpha)
        
        # Crossdissolve the two warped images
        frame = cross_dissolve(warped_start, warped_end, alpha)
        
        frames.append(frame)
    return frames

# Assuming start_image, end_image, and feature_points are already defined and loaded
frames = image_morph(person_face, animal_face, matched_feature_points, 30)

# Now, 'frames' contains all the intermediate images for the morph animation
