Given below is a simplified conceptual code snippet:
```python
# Assuming a trained generator 'G' from a GAN

def generate_new_dress_designs(generator, num_designs):
    new_designs = []
    for _ in range(num_designs):
        # Generate a random noise vector
        noise = generate_random_noise()
        
        # Use the generator to create a new dress design
        new_dress = generator.predict(noise)
        
        new_designs.append(new_dress)
    
    return new_designs

# Generate ten new dress designs
new_dress_designs = generate_new_dress_designs(trained_generator, 10)
