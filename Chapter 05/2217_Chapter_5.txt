The conceptual Python-like pseudocode illustrates how you might think about texture synthesis. This will not run as actual code but it is meant to give you a simple idea of the process. Refer to the following code for a better understanding:

```python
def texture_synthesis(input_texture, output_size):
     #Initialize an empty image of the desired output size
    output_image = create_empty_image(output_size)
    
     #Loop over each pixel or small block in the output image
    for position in output_image:
         #Find a matching piece from the input texture
         #This involves some criteria to ensure the textures align well
        matching_piece = find_matching_texture(input_texture, position)
        
        # Place the matching piece onto the output image at the current position
        output_image[position] = matching_piece
    
    return output_image

# Load the small patch of grass texture
input_texture = load_texture("small_grass_patch.jpg")

 #Define the size of a football field (or a portion of it for simplicity)
output_size = (10000, 10000)   This is a simplified representation

 Generate the large texture
large_texture = texture_synthesis(input_texture, output_size)

 #Save or display the large texture
save_texture(large_texture, "football_field.jpg")
```
